Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy (glucose) using carbon dioxide and water. Here's how it works:

## Overall Equation
6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

## Two Main Stages

### 1. Light-Dependent Reactions (The Photo Part)
**Location:** Thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts

- **Chlorophyll** absorbs light energy (primarily red and blue wavelengths)
- Water molecules (H₂O) are split, releasing oxygen as a byproduct
- Energy is captured and stored in molecules called **ATP** and **NADPH**
- This stage literally converts light energy into chemical energy

### 2. Light-Independent Reactions/Calvin Cycle (The Synthesis Part)
**Location:** Stroma (fluid space) of chloroplasts

- Uses the ATP and NADPH from stage 1
- **Carbon dioxide** from the air is "fixed" into organic molecules
- Through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, CO₂ is converted into **glucose**
- This stage builds the actual "food" (sugar) molecules

## Key Components
- **Chloroplasts:** The cellular factories where photosynthesis occurs
- **Chlorophyll:** The green pigment that captures light energy
- **Stomata:** Tiny pores in leaves that allow gas exchange (CO₂ in, O₂ out)

## Significance
Photosynthesis is crucial because it:
- Produces oxygen for most life on Earth
- Forms the base of virtually all food chains
- Removes CO₂ from the atmosphere
- Converts solar energy into a form other organisms can use

This process essentially powers most life on Earth by converting sunlight into stored chemical energy!
