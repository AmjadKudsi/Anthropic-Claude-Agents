======================

# First-Time Paris Travel Guide

## Getting Around
**Use the Metro system** - it's your best friend in Paris. Buy a **Navigo Easy card** at any station and load it with day passes or individual rides (€1.90 each). Download **Citymapper** for easy navigation. Most attractions are within walking distance of Metro stops, and many sites connect nicely on foot along the Seine River.

## Must-See Attractions
Start with the **Big Three**:
1. **Eiffel Tower** - Visit during the day and return at night for the hourly light show
2. **Louvre Museum** - Book timed entry tickets online; plan 3-4 hours minimum  
3. **Notre-Dame area** - While the cathedral is under restoration, the surrounding Île de la Cité is still stunning

**Pro tip:** These three sites form a perfect walking route along the Seine - easily done in one day.

## Cultural Do's and Don'ts

**Essential Politeness:**
- Say "Bonjour" entering any shop/restaurant and "Au revoir" when leaving
- Learn basic phrases - even poor French is appreciated
- Dress nicely; presentation matters in France

**Dining Basics:**
- Make restaurant reservations when possible
- Don't rush meals - take your time
- Keep hands visible on the table
- Tipping is optional (service included in bill)

**Social Norms:**
- Use formal "vous" unless invited to use "tu"
- Speak quietly in public
- Don't expect strangers to smile back on the street

## Practical Tips
- Many attractions are walkable from each other - comfortable shoes essential
- Use Vélib' bikes for short trips in good weather  
- Avoid taxis during rush hour; stick to Metro
- Book popular restaurants and museum entry times in advance

**Emergency French:** "Pardon, parlez-vous anglais?" (Excuse me, do you speak English?)

Follow these basics and you'll navigate Paris like a respectful, savvy traveler!
