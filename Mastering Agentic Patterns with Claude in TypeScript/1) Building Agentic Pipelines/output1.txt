I'll analyze this rectangular garden problem and break it down into a clear, sequential plan.

## Problem Analysis

This problem involves two separate calculations for a rectangular garden:
1. Finding the perimeter (for fencing)
2. Finding the area (for grass seed requirements)

## Given Information
- Garden dimensions: 12 meters long × 8 meters wide
- Grass seed rate: 0.25 kg per square meter

## Step-by-Step Solution Plan

### Part 1: Fencing Requirement (Perimeter Calculation)

**Step 1:** Identify the perimeter formula for a rectangle
- Formula needed: Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)

**Step 2:** Substitute the given values
- Calculate: 2 × (12 + 8)

**Step 3:** Perform the calculation
- First: Add the length and width (12 + 8)
- Then: Multiply the sum by 2

### Part 2: Grass Seed Requirement (Area Calculation)

**Step 4:** Identify the area formula for a rectangle
- Formula needed: Area = length × width

**Step 5:** Calculate the garden's area
- Calculate: 12 × 8

**Step 6:** Calculate total grass seed needed
- Multiply the area by the seed rate (0.25 kg per square meter)
- Calculate: Area × 0.25

## Expected Outputs
- Fencing needed: [perimeter result] meters
- Grass seed needed: [grass seed result] kilograms

This plan provides a systematic approach to solve both parts of the garden problem, with each calculation clearly defined and sequenced.
