# Complete Solution: Garden Fencing and Grass Seed Problem

## Problem
A rectangular garden is 12 meters long and 8 meters wide. We need to find:
1. How much fencing is needed to go around the perimeter
2. How much grass seed is required at a rate of 0.25 kg per square meter

## Solution

### Part 1: Finding the Fencing Needed (Perimeter)

**What we're doing:** To fence around the entire garden, we need to calculate the perimeter - the total distance around the outside edge.

**Formula:** For a rectangle, Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)

**Step-by-step calculation:**
- Length = 12 meters
- Width = 8 meters
- Perimeter = 2 × (12 + 8)
- Perimeter = 2 × 20
- **Perimeter = 40 meters**

**Why this works:** A rectangle has 4 sides - 2 lengths and 2 widths. So we add one length plus one width, then multiply by 2 to account for both pairs of opposite sides.

### Part 2: Finding the Grass Seed Needed (Area Calculation)

**What we're doing:** To determine grass seed needed, we first calculate the total area of the garden, then multiply by the seeding rate.

**Step 1 - Calculate Area:**
- Formula: Area = length × width
- Area = 12 × 8 = **96 square meters**

**Step 2 - Calculate Grass Seed:**
- Rate: 0.25 kg per square meter
- Total seed needed = Area × Rate
- Total seed = 96 × 0.25 = **24 kilograms**

**Why this works:** Area gives us the total surface space to be covered. Multiplying by the seeding rate (kg per m²) gives us the total amount of seed needed.

## Final Answers
- **Fencing needed:** 40 meters
- **Grass seed needed:** 24 kilograms

This rectangular garden (12m × 8m) requires 40 meters of fencing to enclose its 96 square meter area and 24 kilograms of grass seed to cover the entire surface.
