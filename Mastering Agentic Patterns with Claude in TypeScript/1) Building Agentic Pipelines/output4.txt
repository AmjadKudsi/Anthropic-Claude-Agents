# Solution: Rectangular Garden Fencing and Grass Seed Requirements

## Problem
A rectangular garden is 12 meters long and 8 meters wide. We need to find:
1. How much fencing is needed for the perimeter
2. How much grass seed is required at 0.25 kg per square meter

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Calculate the Perimeter (for fencing)
To find how much fencing is needed, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle.

**Formula:** Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)

**Calculation:**
- Perimeter = 2 × (12 + 8)
- Perimeter = 2 × 20
- **Perimeter = 40 meters**

### Step 2: Calculate the Area (for grass seed coverage)
To determine grass seed requirements, we need the total area of the garden.

**Formula:** Area = length × width

**Calculation:**
- Area = 12 × 8
- **Area = 96 square meters**

### Step 3: Calculate Grass Seed Requirements
Now we multiply the area by the seeding rate to find total grass seed needed.

**Formula:** Grass seed needed = Area × seeding rate

**Calculation:**
- Grass seed = 96 × 0.25
- **Grass seed = 24 kg**

## Final Answer

For this 12m × 8m rectangular garden:
- **Fencing needed: 40 meters**
- **Grass seed needed: 24 kg**

## Why These Calculations Work
- **Perimeter calculation:** We add all four sides of the rectangle, which is the same as adding length + width, then doubling it
- **Area calculation:** For rectangles, we simply multiply length by width to get the total coverage area
- **Grass seed calculation:** We multiply the coverage area by the application rate to get the total amount needed
