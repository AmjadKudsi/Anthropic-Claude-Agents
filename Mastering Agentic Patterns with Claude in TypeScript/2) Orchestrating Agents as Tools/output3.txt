📊 Agent response (calculator_assistant): **Solution:**

The quadratic equation x² - 5x + 6 = 0 has two solutions:
- x₁ = 3
- x₂ = 2

**Verification:**
This equation can also be factored as (x - 3)(x - 2) = 0, which confirms our solutions.

You can verify by substitution:
- For x = 3: 3² - 5(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0 ✓
- For x = 2: 2² - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0 ✓

=== Final Response ===

The solution to the equation x² - 5x + 6 = 0 is:

**x = 3 or x = 2**

This quadratic equation has two real solutions. The equation can be factored as (x - 3)(x - 2) = 0, which makes it clear that x = 3 and x = 2 are the roots.

You can verify these solutions by substituting back into the original equation:
- For x = 3: 3² - 5(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0 ✓
- For x = 2: 2² - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0 ✓
