📊 Agent response (verifier_assistant): **Verification Result:**

When x = 4 is substituted into the equation 4x - 7 = 9:
- Left side: 4(4) - 7 = 16 - 7 = 9
- Right side: 9

Since the left side equals the right side (9 = 9), **x = 4 is indeed the correct solution** to the equation 4x - 7 = 9.

The solution has been verified successfully.

=== Final Response ===

The solution to the equation 4x - 7 = 9 is **x = 4**.

Here's how to solve it:
1. Start with: 4x - 7 = 9
2. Add 7 to both sides: 4x = 16
3. Divide both sides by 4: x = 4

To verify: When we substitute x = 4 back into the original equation:
4(4) - 7 = 16 - 7 = 9 ✓

The solution checks out correctly.
