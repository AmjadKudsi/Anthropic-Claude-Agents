=== Final Response ===

I can help you solve the quadratic equation x² - 5x + 6 = 0.

For a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, I can solve it by factoring or using the quadratic formula.

Let me factor this equation:
x² - 5x + 6 = 0

I need to find two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -5.
Those numbers are -2 and -3, since:
- (-2) × (-3) = 6
- (-2) + (-3) = -5

So the equation factors as:
(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0

Using the zero product property, either:
- x - 2 = 0, which gives x = 2
- x - 3 = 0, which gives x = 3

Therefore, the solutions to the equation x² - 5x + 6 = 0 are **x = 2** and **x = 3**.

You can verify: 
- For x = 2: (2)² - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0 ✓
- For x = 3: (3)² - 5(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0 ✓
